Notes and remarks:

- The report above was computed from the latest JaCoCo CSV output generated by the test run; it summarizes the key coverage metrics and a compact per-package line coverage breakdown.
- I intentionally did not include or expose any build/target directory listings or internal report files in this document.
- If you want an expanded breakdown (top uncovered classes, per-class metrics, or an HTML report artifact placed into a specific location), tell me which format you prefer and I will add it.

Status:
- TEST_REPORT.md replaced with fresh coverage summary.
